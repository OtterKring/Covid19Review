# Covid-19 in Austria. A Review

## December 2019

First news about the virus in China arrive.

## February 2020

Asia closes ports for cruise ships.

Austria closes airports for planes from China in mid-February.

## March 2020

### March 15th, Lockdown I

The first Lockdown is ordered.

### March 16th

The first hard Lockdown. The government estimates it to last for 2 weeks.

My wife and I discuss, that an infectiuous outbreak follows exponentional growth, which means the numbers will keep rising as long as the reproduction value is higher than 1.

*We estimate the Lockdown to last 6-8 weeks rather than 2.*

## April 2020

### April 17th

The Lockdown, which should last for 2 weeks, last for 4 weeks by now. Visiting doctors is allowed again.

## May 2020

### May 1st

6 weeks of Lockdown. Body-related services are opened again, shops with more than 400m2 business area likewise. Distancing rules apply.

### May 29th

All restrictions are removed, except the nightly curfew.

The Lockdown which was estimated to last for 2 weeks actually lasted for 10 weeks, including the "fade-out".

* **Infection numbers fell drastically**
* **The reduction was only visible after 2 weeks**

## Summer 2020

Nearly all restrictions have been revoked, even the obligatory masks (MNS at that time). People are travelling for vacation, even to countries with a much higher count of infections.

Numbers are rising, but there is no news from the government about further actions.

In October I tell my colleagues at work, *that we will have another Lockdown in November.*

## November 2020

### November 17th, Lockdown II

Government calls for a "Lockdown light".

My wife and I forsee: *If they open before christmas, we will be locked down again right after until March at best.*

## December 2020

### December 8th

Shops may open again to profit from christmas sales.

As we get to know later, many people had already done their christmas shopping online. The healthwise risky christmas sale does not meet expectations.

### December 24th

Exceptions for the holidays: 8 adults and 6 children are allowed to meet for christmas celebrations.

### December 26th, Lockdown III

The third (hard) Lockdown starts. Infection numbers are about 6 times higher than when the first Lockdown started (which lasted for 10 weeks).

## February 2021

### February 8th

The shops may open again, but only for tested people. The new and more infectiuous variant B 1.1.7 of the virus spreads.

* **People go testing massively, because it is the only chance to apply for certain services**
* **Since many people are testing, infection numbers rise quickly. It's the first time we see "realistic" values**
* **The reproduction value decreases only very slowly. This may be due to the higher infectiousness of B 1.1.7 or because of the many tests. The latter would explain, why infection numbers were still on the rise in earlier Lockdowns while the reproduction value had already dropped below 1. The missing number from untested people distorted the result, in our opinion.**

## March 2021

### March 6th

Lockdown III would have ended here, had it lasted for 10 weeks, as Lockdown I did.

## April 2021

### April 1st, Lockdown IV

The government calls for regional measures. In eastern Austria an "Easterrest" is ordered for just short of a week, again the recommendations of minister of health Mr Anschober, who already votes for a more rigorous procedure.

My wife and I assume, that, according to our experience from the past months, *a Lockdown must last for at least 2 weeks to make a difference in the progress of the infection.*

Mrs Rendi-Wagner from the socialist party as well as the Viennese major Mr Ludwig confirmed our assumption one day later. The Lockdown is prolonged to almost 2 weeks, to April 18th.j

### April 12th

A political discussion has arisen to prolong Lockdown IV even futher. The IC units in our hospitals are pushing their limits. The new patients are younger than before and they must stay longer.

My wife and I discuss: *If a Lockdown is not based on infection numbers anymore, but on used IC beds, 2 weeks will not be enough, because patients arrive their quite some time after their infection and stay longer. The effect of the Lockdown on the IC units will therefore show a lot later. We estimate 4-6 weeks until we see any results there.*

* **Major Ludwig prolongs the Lockdown after having spoken to medical personel for another 3 weeks, to May 1st.**

We foresee: *3 weeks is a step in the right direction. Still, we expect the Lockdown to last until mid May or maybe June, as long as it is based on take IC beds.*

# What we (my wife and I) learned up to now

* a soft Lockdown hardly has any medically relevant effects. At best the situation stalls, but an improvement is unlikely. It is a pure political act to calm the voices of economy.
* it requires a hard Lockdown of at least 2 weeks (based on the original virus), to flatten the infection curve or reverse it.
* if numbers were higher at the beginning or should be lowered more the Lockdown must last longer accordingly.
* free tests are great, but it was obvious that people only go testing if they directly profit (a haircut is enough). "I want to know my status" is no motivation to test.
* a hard Lockdown lowers infection numbers, but the statistics become less exact compared to the time of testing, because people loose reasons to test. So you cannot directly compare the decreasing numbers from a Lockdown to the numbers during times of heavy testing.

**and ...**

... inability to plan into the future is no issue, if you follow what happened and think along.
